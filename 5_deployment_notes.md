# 🛠️ Deployment Strategy for Credit Card Fraud Detection

This file outlines potential deployment options for the fraud detection model developed in this project. The focus is on both **batch** and **real-time** scoring use cases, along with monitoring and model management.

---

## ⚙️ 1. Batch Scoring (Offline)

**Scenario**: Large volumes of transactions are scored daily or hourly.

**How it works:**
- Schedule a Databricks Job to run the final pipeline notebook
- Load new transactions from a Delta Lake or data warehouse
- Run predictions and write results back to a secure storage table
- Connect to Power BI / Tableau for dashboards or alerts

**Tools**:
- Databricks Jobs Scheduler
- Delta Tables
- Power BI / Tableau

---

## ⚡ 2. Real-Time Scoring (Online)

**Scenario**: Predict fraud risk instantly when a transaction happens.

**How it works:**
- Register the trained model using MLflow
- Serve the model via REST API using Databricks Model Serving or a Flask + Docker app
- Connect the API to the transaction pipeline (e.g., through a message broker or payment gateway)

**Tools**:
- MLflow Model Registry
- Databricks Model Serving or Flask API
- AWS Lambda / Azure Functions (optional)

---

## 🧪 3. Model Monitoring & Maintenance

To ensure continued performance over time:

- Track **Precision, Recall, F1-score** weekly
- Watch for **drift** in:
  - Input features (distribution shift)
  - Output predictions (class imbalance changes)
- Retrain using updated datasets quarterly or monthly

**Tools**:
- MLflow Logging
- Great Expectations (optional)
- Databricks Alerts / Dashboards

## 🚀 Next Steps (Not Yet Implemented)

- [ ] Register model in MLflow and version it
- [ ] Package model into a serving endpoint (API or Databricks serving)
- [ ] Build basic monitoring script to log model accuracy over time
- [ ] Automate batch pipeline with new incoming data

## 🧠 Business Value

- 🚫 Catch fraudulent transactions in near real-time
- ✅ Reduce manual reviews by flagging only high-risk items
- 📉 Minimize false positives to avoid unnecessary customer friction

> This deployment plan is intentionally lightweight and modular. It can scale from local testing to enterprise-grade pipelines as needed.
